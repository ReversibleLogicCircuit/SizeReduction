# Example

In this page, it is explained how to synthesis with proposed algorithm.

A target function is randomly generated with "randomPermutationGenerator.py" and is 6-bit function.

## Description

- randomPermutationGenerator.py: source for making a random function.
- example.function: random 6-bit fucntion
- exampe_out.real: output of synthesis (.real format)

## How to synthesis with example function

We recommand to type "Python ./syntehsis.py -h" first.

"python ./syntehsis.py ./example.function 6 0" or "python ./syntehsis.py ./example.function 6 1 1 1 1 1"
